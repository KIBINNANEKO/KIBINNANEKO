# üí´ About Me:
Currently, I am a 3rd-year student at Kharkiv Polytechnic University, majoring in Systems Analysis, Faculty of Computer Science.

I am deeply passionate about programming and everything related to it, which is why I am motivated to grow and learn. I have been successfully doing so for over three years now. Throughout this time, I have explored various programming-related areas, including C++, C#, data analysis and visualization, Telegram bots, and Python-based web scraping. However, what fascinated me the most was interface development.

Therefore, in the past few years, I have been actively studying Web Front-end Development, which is also highly relevant in today's world. During my learning journey, I have acquired a wide range of knowledge and skills. Through working on personal projects, participating in hackathons, and completing an internship, I am now seeking a place where I can fully apply my skills.

In February 2023, I participated in the "INT20H" hackathon organized by the KPI, where I successfully developed two interesting web applications (a test version and a main part) in collaboration with other developers. It was during this experience that I first felt confident in my ability to create something more significant than just educational projects.
